# Modeling the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill
A comprehensive project looking at the oil spill which occurred in the Gulf of Mexico of 2010 attempting to model just how extensive the damage of the oil spill was.

Using Juypter Notebooks and GIS data from 2010, an equation estimate was made based on the amount of oil that allowed us to extrapolate the damage of the spill. With a sufficient model of the spill, we also able to look at the social justice issues of the spill, and the devestation the spill had not only on the ocean and marine animals, but also the people who lived closest to the spill. Overall, we determined that even with the data collected of how many barrels were spilled over the 85 days, there was probably an exponential amount of barrels spilled that went unaccounted for that polluted the Gulf and surrounded areas.
